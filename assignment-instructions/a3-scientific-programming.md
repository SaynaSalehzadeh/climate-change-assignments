## 1. Introduction
Scientific computing--using computer algorithms to solve scientific problems--plays an important role in research for many modern scientific disciplines. By developing computer programs that collect, refine, analyze, and visualize experimental data, scientists are able to explore new scientific hypotheses and broaden their understanding of physical phenomena and relationships. Even in cases where datasets are small and relatively straightforward, using scripted, programming approaches can greatly improve the efficiency and reproducibility of scientific analysis.

Further to this point, it is very likely that as your scientific career progresses, you will find yourself in a situation where using a programmatic approach is required to complete your research work, and/or immensely beneficial and time-saving in comparison to other approaches. Though you may not have expertise with a specific programming application, having knowledge of the basics of programming and scientific computing, and the confidence to experiment and continue to learn will be invaluable assets. To this end, the goal of this workshop is to develop both of these aspects, while also introducing you to best practices in creating and maintaining scientific code. 

The purpose of this workshop is to provide you with an introduction to the MATLAB software package and improve your knowledge of programming and scientific computing. In addition, you’ll have an opportunity to further explore climate change over the past decade through a (programmatic) re-visitation of the international weather station data used in your second assignment.
